# latex-template

My go-to LaTeX templates used throughout undergrad years at Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam.

This repository includes templates for a thesis, notebook and presentation slides.

I am sincerely honored to mention a few nicknames of individuals who inspired me in creating these templates:

Hirose209 (HUST alumni), amysteriousperson (xPhO) and Log (xPhO).
